  - uses variables, a Python list, and `f-strings` or concatenation to:
    - calculate and display a student's average test score
  - Your list should contain at least five (5) test scores for the student
  - Use the `len()` and `sum()` functions as needed in your script
  - Display the student's name, his/her individual test scores, and his/her AVERAGE test score
  - Your output should be neat and easy to read
