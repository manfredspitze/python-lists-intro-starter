- Terms related to Python lists you should be familar with by the end of the unit include:
  - square bracket notation
  - index number
  - negative index number
  - list item (also known as a **list element**)
  - list slicing
  - to **append** an item to a list
  - lists are **zero-based** (What does this mean in plain English?)
  - In other languages, lists are known as *arrays*  (but they're really the same thing)
